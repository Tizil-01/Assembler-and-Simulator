* Add the assembler code in the Simple-Assembler directory. Add the commands to execute the assembler in Simple-Assembler/run.
* Add the simulator code in the SimpleSimulator directory. Add the commands to execute the assembler in SimpleSimulator/run.
* Make sure that both the assembler and the simulator read from stdin.
* Make sure that both the assembler and the simulator write to stdout.
